# Contributing to ASCS Capstone Project

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Guidelines

- **Be Respectful**: Always be respectful and considerate in your interactions with others.
- **Ask Questions**: If you are unsure about something, feel free to ask questions. We are here to help!
- **Follow Coding Standards**: Make sure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.
- **Test Your Changes**: Before submitting your changes, make sure to test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.
- **Do Not Use AI to Generate All Your Code**: While AI tools can be helpful, it is important to understand and write your own code. Use AI as a learning tool, not a crutch.

## Getting Help

If you need help at any point, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers or ask for help in the project's discussion forums.

Happy coding!
